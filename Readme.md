# Sketch2Face – Sketch to Realistic Face Generation using CNN & GAN

## 📌 Overview
Sketch2Face is a deep learning project that converts hand-drawn facial sketches into realistic face images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

The model learns to translate sketch domain images into photorealistic face images through adversarial training.
